Each folder contains multiple .java files, each representing a unique problem or concept. 📚

🛠️ How This Repository Was Created
Folder Structure: Organized by topic for easy navigation and progressive learning.
Problem Solving: Each file was created to solve a specific Java problem, starting from basics (like sum of numbers) to advanced (like matrix operations).
Naming Convention: Files are named to reflect the problem (e.g., Q1_VOTINGSTUDENTS.java, Q40_BMICalculator.java).
Version Control: Managed using Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
💻 Setting Up Java (JDK) on Your System
Download JDK: Oracle JDK Download
Install JDK: Follow the installation instructions for your OS.
Set JAVA_HOME:
Windows:
Go to System Properties > Environment Variables
Add JAVA_HOME variable pointing to your JDK folder
Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your Path variable
Mac/Linux: Add export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk and export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH to your .bashrc or .zshrc
Verify Installation:
java -version
javac -version
You should see the installed version numbers. ✅
🏃‍♂️ How to Run Java Files
Navigate to the folder containing your .java file using the terminal or command prompt.
