üöÄ Bridgelabz Shiptraining Core Java Practice Repository
Welcome to my Bridgelabz Shiptraining Core Java Practice repo! This project is a hands-on, self-driven collection of Java practice problems and solutions, designed to build solid foundations and sharpen advanced skills in Java. Whether you‚Äôre just starting your programming journey or aiming to master data structures and OOP, this repository is for you!

üìÇ Branches and Structure
This repository is organized into four branches, each tailored for targeted practice and learning:

main: Central collection of Java exercises and examples.

Core_java: Core Java fundamentals‚Äîcovering essentials like data types, control flows, object-oriented programming, and exception handling.

DSA: Practice questions focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms‚Äîarrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting, searching, and more.

OOps: Extensive problems on Object-Oriented Programming concepts‚Äîclasses, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

In every branch, you will find multiple Java files dedicated to specific problems or concepts. All solutions are coded, tested, and briefly commented for clarity.

üèóÔ∏è How the Repository Is Organized
Topic-Based Folders: Questions and solutions are grouped by topic for easy access.

Each File = One Problem: Each .java file tackles a unique coding challenge, from basic to advanced.

Descriptive Naming: File names clearly reflect the problem addressed (for example, PrimeNumberChecker.java or ArrayReverse.java).

Git Versioning: Source code and progress are tracked using Git. Multiple branches separate core topics, DSA, and OOP practice.

üíª Getting Started
1. Prerequisite: Java (JDK)
Install Java (JDK) on your system.

Download from the official Oracle site.

Follow instructions suited to your OS.

Set up environment variables (JAVA_HOME and update Path).

2. Verify Your Installation

bash
java -version
javac -version
This will confirm your Java setup is correct.

3. Running an Example File

Navigate to the folder with the .java file.

Compile:

bash
javac FileName.java
Run:

bash
java FileName
(Note: do not include .java in the run command.)

üõ† Example Topics and Files
Branch	Example File	Focus
Core_java	LeapYearChecker.java	If-else, loops, control flow
DSA	MergeSortImplementation.java	Sorting algorithms
OOps	ShapeInheritance.java	Inheritance, abstraction in classes
main	SimpleCalculator.java	Arithmetic operations, user input
All files are well-commented for easy understanding.

This repository is organized into four main branches, each dedicated to a specific area:
main: The default branch with the latest configurations and summaries of my practice sessions.
Core_java: Contains all my Java practice questions, tackling fundamental and advanced Java concepts.
DSA: Stores problems centered around data structures, algorithms, and their implementations.
OOPs: Focuses on object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, and related exercises.
