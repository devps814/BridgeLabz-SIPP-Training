## 🛠️ How This Repository Was Created

1. **Folder Structure**: Organized by topic for easy navigation and progressive learning.
2. **Problem Solving**: Each file was created to solve a specific Java problem, starting from basics (like sum of numbers) to advanced (like matrix operations).
3. **Naming Convention**: Files are named to reflect the problem (e.g., `Q1_VOTINGSTUDENTS.java`, `Q40_BMICalculator.java`).
4. **Version Control**: Managed using Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

## 💻 Setting Up Java (JDK) on Your System

1. **Download JDK**: [Oracle JDK Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. **Install JDK**: Follow the installation instructions for your OS.
3. **Set JAVA_HOME**:
   - **Windows**: 
     - Go to System Properties > Environment Variables
     - Add `JAVA_HOME` variable pointing to your JDK folder
     - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your `Path` variable
   - **Mac/Linux**: Add `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk` and `export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```
   You should see the installed version numbers. ✅

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run Java Files

1. **Navigate to the folder** containing your `.java` file using the terminal or command prompt.
2. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. **Run the compiled class**:
   ```sh
   java FileName
   ```
   (Do not include `.java` in the run command!)
